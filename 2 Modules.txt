Modules (also referred to as “task plugins” or “library plugins”) are discrete units of code that can be used from the command line or in a playbook task.


example for use of a module:

ansible.builtin.find module – Return a list of files based on specific criteria:

ex: find all all files in downloads

one way,
inside playbooks:
- name: Use a single pattern that contains a comma formatted as a list
  ansible.builtin.find:
    paths: /Downloads
    file_type: file

other way,
in terminal(ad-hoc commands):
ansible localhost -m find -a "paths=Downloads file_type=file"

here -m for executing module
-a to specify attributes of the module
localhost because we are executing task only in localhost
