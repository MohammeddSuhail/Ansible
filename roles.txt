inside project folder/roles

ansible-galaxy init --offline generate_tar

it will create all these folders and files

defaults  files  handlers  meta  README.md  tasks  templates  tests  vars



tasks, there will be yml file where u can add tasks





ex:

playbook:

---
- name: "playbook for ping system and display details of files"
  hosts: myHosts

  tasks:

  - name: Include Role
    include_role:
      name: generate_tar




inside roles/generate_tar/tasks/main.yml:

---

# tasks file for generate_tar



- name: Read cusumer from CSV file and return a dictionary

  community.general.read_csv:

    path: cust.csv

  register: custu

    

    

- name: "getting that perticular record and storing in rec variable"

  set_fact: 

    rec: "{{item}}"

  when: item.Customer == customer_name 

  with_items: '{{custu.list}}'

    

    

- name: "setting accesssed_by to psql if POSTGRESQL"

  set_fact: 

    accesssed_by: "psql"

  when: rec.ICG_VSAM_DB == "POSTGRESQL"

    

      

- name: "setting accesssed_by to sql plus if ORACLE"

  set_fact: 

    accesssed_by: "sql plus"

  when: rec.ICG_VSAM_DB == "ORACLE"

    

- name: "using template to display"

  template:

    src: roles/generate_tar/templates/temp_disp.j2

    dest: result







adding roles inside ansible playbook:
---
- name: some name
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
   - role1
   - role2
   - role3

another way:

- name: Include Role
  include_role:
    name: generate-ini




another way:

  - import_role:
      name: role_name
      tasks_from: tasks1.yml
    tags:
      - postgres

  - import_role:
      name: role_name
      tasks_from: tasks2.yml

directory structure will be something like,
role_name:
  tasks1.yml
  tasks2.yml
