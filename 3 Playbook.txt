indentation and all are important

https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_intro.html


executing playbook:
ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml
or
ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml -v              //this gives more info


ex: these will go inside a YAML file(with yml extension)

---

- name: "My first play"
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:

  - name: "test reachability"
    ping:

  - name: "install stress"
    homebrew:
      name: stress
      state: present  



here ping and homebrew are modules







ex: check system reacabilty of system and display contents of any 2 files

---
- name: "playbook for ping system and display details of files"
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:

  - name: "testing the reachability"
    ping:

  - name: "display details of multiple files"
    ansible.builtin.debug: var=item
    with_file:
      - "~/poem1.txt"
      - "~/poem2.txt"










If the connection is local, then u can reduce the overhead by specifying 
connection: local
in playbook

---
-name: "something"
 hosts: localhost
 connection: local
