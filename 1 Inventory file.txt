inventory file:
List of devices that we want to control/moniter(can use IP addresses or fully qualified domain name)

link: 
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html#inventory-basics-formats-hosts-and-groups


in inventory file:
[group_name]
hosts_under_this_group
[group_name]
hosts_under_this_group

ex:
                        //these are varibles
[southeast] 
localhost               ansible_connection=local 
other1.example.com      ansible_connection=ssh      ansible_user=ubuntu

[northeast] 
other2.example.com 
10.10.100.10 

[southwest] 
10.10.200.10 

[east : children]      //this has both the groups(since we specify them as it's children below)
southeast 
northeast 




another example:


10.0.1.[1 : 3] 

[all_hosts]
target1 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.1.239 
target2 ansible_ssh_host-10.0.1.94 
target3 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.1.252 
target4 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.1.133 
target5 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.1.4 
target6 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.1.82 

[webservers] 
target1 
target2 
target3 

[dbservers] 
target4 
target5 
target6 

[backupservers] 
target6 backup_file=/tmp/test1 

[all : vars] 
temp_file=/tmp/test2 







1.
create inventory file
ex:
[myHosts]
localhost               ansible_connection=local 


2.
can specify the gropu_name in playbook
ex: we used myHosts group
---
- name: "playbook for ping system and display details of files"
  hosts: myHosts

  tasks:

  - name: "testing the reachability"
    ping:
 
  - name: "display details of multiple files"
    ansible.builtin.debug: var=item
    with_file:
      - "~/poem1.txt"
      - "~/poem2.txt"





3.
while executing use:
ansible-playbook -i inventory_file_name playbook_name.yml 
ex:
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook_name.yml 

or

ansible-playbook playbook_name.yml 
U neednot specify the inventory file, if u have specified in cfg file






If you have a lot of hosts with a similar pattern, you can add them as a range rather than listing each hostname separately:


[webservers]
www[01:50].example.com
