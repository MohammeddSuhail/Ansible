1. create ssh keys on app server.

2. Add this key (id_rsa.pub) to the authorized_keys file on the db server(.ssh/authorized_keys).
   You can perform the below command on app server to do that.
   ssh-copy-id username@IP_Address_of_DB_Server

3. If we don't mention ansible_ssh_pass=db_server_pw ansible_ssh_user=db_server_username,

   Then while executing the playbook we must give --ask-pass, where you have to enter password to account on db server.
   ex: 
    ansible-playbook sample.yml -i inventory --ask-pass
   
   If we specify then just,
   ex: 
   ansible-playbook sample.yml -i inventory



On db server you must have sudo access to "postgres" account
